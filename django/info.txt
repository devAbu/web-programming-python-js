We will use Python's Django framework in order to create dynamic applications

- A dynamic website is one that takes advantage of a programming language (such as Python) to dynamically generate HTML and CSS files. 

*** HTTP ***

- HTTP, or HyperText Transfer Protocol, is a widely-accepted protocol for how messages are transfered back and forth across the internet. Typically, information online is passed between a client (user) and a server.

- In this protocol, the client will send a request to the server, that might look something like the one below. In the example below, GET is simply a type of request, one of three we’ll discuss in this course. The / typically indicates that we’re looking for the website’s home page, and the three dots indicate that we could be passing in more information as well.
  --- SLIKA: HTTP1 ---

- After receiving a request, a server will then send back an HTTP response, which might look something like the one below. Such a response will include the HTTP version, a status code (200 means OK), a description of the content, and then some additional information.
  --- SLIKA: HTTP2 ---

  - 200 is just one of many status codes, some of which you may have seen in the past:
    --- SLIKA: StatusCode ---


*** DJANGO ***

- Django is a Python-based web framework that will allow us to write Python code that dynamically generates HTML and CSS. The advantage to using a framework like Django is that a lot of code is already written for us that we can take advantage of.

DJANGO: https://www.djangoproject.com/start/

  - To get started, we’ll have to install Django, which means you’ll also have to install pip if you haven’t already done so.
  - Once you have Pip installed, you can run pip3 install Django in your terminal to install Django.

  - After installing Django, we can go through the steps of creating a new Django project:
    1. Run django-admin startproject PROJECT_NAME to create a number of starter files for our project.
    2. Run cd PROJECT_NAME to navigate into your new project’s directory.
    3. Open the directory in your text editor of choice. You’ll notice that some files have been created for you. We won’t need to look at most of these for now, but there are three that will be very important from the start:
      - manage.py is what we use to execute commands on our terminal. We won’t have to edit it, but we’ll use it often.
      - settings.py contains some important configuration settings for our new project. There are some default settings, but we may wish to change some of them from time to time.
      - urls.py contains directions for where users should be routed after navigating to a certain URL.
    4. Start the project by running python manage.py runserver. This will open a development server, which you can access by visiting the URL provided. This development server is being run locally on your machine, meaning other people cannot access your website. This should bring you to a default landing page
    5. Next, we’ll have to create an application. Django projects are split into one or more applications. Most of our projects will only require one application, but larger sites can make use of this ability to split a site into multiple apps. To create an application, we run python manage.py startapp APP_NAME. This will create some additional directories and files that will be useful shortly, including views.py.
    6. Now, we have to install our new app. To do this, we go to settings.py, scroll down to the list of INSTALLED_APPS, and add the name of our new application to this list
