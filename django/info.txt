We will use Python's Django framework in order to create dynamic applications

- A dynamic website is one that takes advantage of a programming language (such as Python) to dynamically generate HTML and CSS files. 

*** HTTP ***

- HTTP, or HyperText Transfer Protocol, is a widely-accepted protocol for how messages are transfered back and forth across the internet. Typically, information online is passed between a client (user) and a server.

- In this protocol, the client will send a request to the server, that might look something like the one below. In the example below, GET is simply a type of request, one of three we’ll discuss in this course. The / typically indicates that we’re looking for the website’s home page, and the three dots indicate that we could be passing in more information as well.

- After receiving a request, a server will then send back an HTTP response, which might look something like the one below. Such a response will include the HTTP version, a status code (200 means OK), a description of the content, and then some additional information.
  --- SLIKA: HTTP2 ---

  - 200 is just one of many status codes, some of which you may have seen in the past:
    --- SLIKA: StatusCode ---
